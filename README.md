# PKG
A package manager/bootstrapper written in go.

This is barely a package manager, it uses github api and only supports a very
limited number of packages(more limited than you expect).

# Motivation
This project is mostly a personal project as I need a bootstrapping tool for
my shell scripts. I have written a few shell based bootstrappers before but
I wanted to write one in go to speed it up and have access to higher level
features.
